## Gulp Compilation

2. `npm install`
3. `gulp` (build)
4. `gulp watch` (to watch the changes)

## Git Workflow

1. In order to create a feature branch, pull the latest changes of the `main` branch and use the latest code of the `main` branch to create the feature branch:
```
$ git checkout main
$ git fetch origin
$ git rebase origin/main
```
2. Create the feature branch using the ticket number of the task ticket, e.g if the ticket ID is BCHT-1 then name the feature branch name as `BCHT-1` :
```
$ git checkout -b BCHT-1
```
Note: kindly avoid using the user story number for feature branch, unless we do not have any task ticket for the user story.
3. While adding or pushing a commit, make sure the git commit message is prefixed with the ticket key (e.g `BCHT-1:`) and includes details of the changes made:
```
$ git status
$ git add [files]
$ git commit -m "BCHT-1: Created the Generic Page details content type."
$ git push origin BCHT-1
```
4. Make sure to rebase your feature branch with latest code of the `main` branch always before raising the pull request.
5. Navigate to GitHub and open a pull request using the feature branch as origin (e.g `BCHT-1`) and ` main` as the target branch.
6. Fix the merge conflicts (if any), need to make sure there are no merge conflicts in the PR before final review.
7. Add the details of the changes made in the pull request, and attach the screenshots of the components/section worked upon in the PR.
8. Ensure doing the self review of the pull request to identify the common  mistakes and fix them first to avoid any re-open.
9. Add the proper Testings Steps into the `Testing Steps` fields of the Jira ticket worked upon, and then move the ticket into Code Review and assign it to the Team Lead for a review
